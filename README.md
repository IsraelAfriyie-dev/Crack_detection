This research aims to develop a computer vision system for automatically detecting and classifying various types of road cracks. 
This process can be used to improve road maintenance efficiency and safety by enabling faster and more objective identification of road damage. 
This project utilizes the YOLOv8m deep learning model. 
The "m" variant signifies the smaller and faster version of the YOLOv8 model.
